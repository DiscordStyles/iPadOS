## Prerequisites
Install Dependencies:  
Open a terminal or command prompt and use the following command: `npm install`.

## Development
Run the `dev` script with: `npm run dev`.  
This will watch for changes inside the `/src` folder and then auto compile them into your BetterDiscord themes folder.

## Deploying
Run the `build` script with: `npm run build`.  
This will build the `/src` folder excluding the `/src/_theme.css` file to not include the meta and default root.
